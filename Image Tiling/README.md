## Tile large .svs slides into small images

* In the notebooks we clone the [HistCNN](https://github.com/javadnoorb/HistCNN) repository and use the `tile_image.py` script.    

* In `tiling.py`, we integrate all modules, classes, and functions needed for tiling, and add an uploading part to write tiles directly to Google Cloud Bucket.
